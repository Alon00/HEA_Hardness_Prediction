# HEA_Hardness_Prediction
Repository for the code and data of the article "Exploration of Machine Learning Models for High Entropy Alloys Hardness Prediction"

The code consists of 4 files. One that prepares the databases from the raw data, another which builds and runs the models, a code to make new experimental predictions and a final one that includes supplementary functions used in the previous files. All of the code is commented and sectioned to enhance legibility.
